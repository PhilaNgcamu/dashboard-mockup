PROJECT: VOLUNTEER PAIR-PROGRAMMING DASHBOARD

Goal: Set up a system for experienced volunteers to connect with individual recruits' projects to share technical knowledge and support, without needing a staff member to be involved (due to the rapidly growing number of projects requiring reviews).

Ideas:

- Volunteers who are interested in JavaScript or Python can help students/recruits with their specific projects.

- Volunteers should have access to a section where they can view recruit's project submissions.

- Volunteers should be able to see previous code reviews for the projects and add their own reviews.

- The volunteer/reviewer should have access to relevant information and actions across different recruits' project cards.

Prioritizing pairing sessions:

Goal: Help volunteers make informed decisions about who to help and how to help.

- In some cases, a staff member may consider a recruit's project to be incompetent, even if other reviewers have marked it as competent. In such cases, a pairing session is needed to address any knowledge gaps identified by staff members or other reviewers.

- Scheduling a Google Meet session can facilitate the pairing session.

Identifying individuals who are struggling:

- Frequent movement of project cards back and forth indicates a problem.

- The issue could be due to a reviewer's poor explanation or review, the assignee's misunderstanding, or confusing project specifications.

- Solution - The system should allow volunteers to identify where the problem may occur and determine the next steps. A solution could involve setting up a meeting via Google Meet to clarify any confusion.

Supporting the helpers:

- Including a trending card to encourage recruits to attend project reviews.

- Building the dashboard using React. Most of the components can be implemented as cards or sections under basic tabs provided by MUI (Material-UI).
